// Feature README Template

// This template is used to generate a README for each new feature

// It explains folder structure, guidelines, and best practices.

export const featureReadme = (featureName) => `
# Feature Module: ${featureName}

This folder is a **template** for creating new features.
To add a new feature:

1. **Run** \`npx create-lscs-app feature <feature-name>\`
   → This automatically sets up the full feature structure.
2. Start implementing your feature logic, UI, and hooks inside this folder.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- \`components/\`
  - \`atoms/\` → Smallest reusable UI elements (buttons, inputs, icons).
  - \`molecules/\` → Groups of atoms working together (forms, cards).
  - \`organisms/\` → Complex UI sections composed of molecules and atoms.
- \`containers/\` → Smart components that connect UI with logic, hooks, and services.
- \`hooks/\` → Custom React hooks specific to this feature.
- \`services/\` → Handles API calls, endpoints, or feature-specific logic.
- \`queries/\` → TanStack Query hooks/configs for data fetching.
- \`types/\` → TypeScript types/interfaces for the feature.
- \`data/\` → Static or mock data (temporary before API integration).

## 🧭 Guidelines

- Follow the **Atomic Design** principle inside \`components/\`.
- Use the **Container/Presentational** pattern for clean separation.
- Keep **business logic** in \`containers/\`, **UI** in \`components/\`.
- Always type with **TypeScript**.
- Use **Zustand** for client state (if applicable).
- Use **TanStack Query** for server-side data management.
- Avoid shared state or components unless truly global.

✅ This structure ensures each feature is **modular**, **scalable**, and **easy to maintain** within the LSCS architecture.
